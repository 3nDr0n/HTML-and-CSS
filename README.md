HTML AND CSS PROJECTS

Here is a collection of sample websites I have written in HTML and CSS for Tech Academy`s Web Developer Bootcamp.

The "bootsrap_project is a simple website for a cimena that I have styled using Bootstrap 5.

The "student_portfolio" project is an evolving site where you can find some information about me as a developer and my past exerience.
